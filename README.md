## About me ✍️:

Hey! I'm Omer Karp, a student at Bar Ilan Univarsity, and a Backend & Blockchain Developer at DcentraLab.
I have been coding for ~4 years now and love making projects, and my focus is on *QUALITY*.

If you want to, give a look to some of my projects, maybe you'll find some inspiration 😄
